## NYC_Bike_Linear_Regression


I used the New York Bike Counts dataset to formulate a hypothesis about the number of bikes crossing the Brooklyn Bridge. This dataset contains the number of bikes that crossed each bridge during each day. I first used this dataset to formulate a hypothesis and then used linear regression to test if my  hypothesis was correct.

## Set Up

1. Imported the dependencies and then imported the data.

2. Inspected the “Day” and “Brooklyn Bridge” columns by using a scatter plot.

3. Used the number of bikes crossing the Brooklyn Bridge over time in April as my data, created and documented an analytical question, a hypothesis, a null hypothesis, an alternative hypothesis, and a significance level.

4. Performed a linear regression to evaluate my null and alternative hypotheses.

5. Checked the reported p value of the linear regression, and determined if enough evidence exists to reject the null hypothesis.

6. Documented my conclusion in the provided cell.
